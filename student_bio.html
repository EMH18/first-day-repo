      <p>I'm currently an implementations consultant at SecurEnds, Inc. 
        I've been working at my current position for roughly 4 months so far. 
        Prior to this position I have worked as a Business Analyst at TSYS, a Manufacturing Software Engineer at Caire, Inc., and an engineer at Lockheed Martin.
      </p>

      <p>I am hoping to get back to my software/more technical roots as an outcome of this certification. 
        I work directly with clients and I would prefer to reverse my career path more towards where I began.
